Cloud Strife is a former member of SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company. Shinra uses mako, the Planet's spiritual energy, harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis of Midgar and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart, Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization, led by Barret Wallace, who believes excessive mako harvesting will cause environmental disaster, which they attempt to prevent by bombing a mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of Sephiroth, an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist Aerith Gainsborough. Although Cloud intends to leave Avalanche after receiving his pay, mysterious ghost-like entities, who often reappear at pivotal moments in the game, cause him to be recruited for another reactor bombing, which goes awry, separating him from the group.
